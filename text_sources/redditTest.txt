What? Why would anyone not do this? Hell, I'd take home other people's food too if it was allowed.
It could just be me or the people I hang out with, but I have called people out on that shit before and it seems to stop when I do. I'm kind of a blunt asshole about it but I don't have an issue telling someone, "you said it was okay. We made sure and did our job to make everyone happy and you said it was cool. I don't care if you're mad that is 100% your problem and yours alone. If you have an issue, speak up."

That seems to work.
Seriously though, it is sociable acceptable to wear skirts and not seen as daring or that I am making an statement is the last day I ever wear a pair of pants again.
It's not the fact they made mistakes in itself. It's the fact that they testified as to the reliability of the methods they used. When a witness gives scientific testimony the prosecutor or defense will ask them about the reliability of their methods. They do this with everything from the intoxilyzer to DNA analysis. The forensic scientists falsely attested that certain methods were significantly more reliable and less error prone than they actually were. 

They either didn't know their methods had high error rates, or they intentionally lied about it. 

The issue isn't the mistakes themselves, as much as their testimony about the rate which mistakes occur.

Had a once in a lifetime opportunity to travel in East Africa, doing some light consulting work. Fortunately I had worked long enough at my job to qualify for a leave of absence, so I had a job waiting when I returned. Tickets were expensive so I budgeted carefully in advance, talking to people who'd spent time in the countries I was visiting. Met amazing people, saw the gorgeous part of the world where we're all from, and learned a ton. So happy I went. Didn't have any cash when I got back, but I slowly made it back.
I envy that assertiveness is not an off putting trait in men. 

This is not from a 'feminist' perspective, I recognize the biological/evolutionary environment facilitating this circumstance. 

I only find it interesting to note that I actively navigate how in a situation, rendering myself assertive does lose me some granted female perks

As a female I can be a bit helpless and gentle and sweet, while being respected and protected and looked out for by the males I am with at the time-- even if not contributing anything directly towards the goal in a situation.

Though should I choose to become assertive in a situation-- I notice often it blurs/confuses their inclination to look out for me or even like me at all

It is something I struggle with in an individuality and equality focused culture while also living in poverty and trying to balance out the best way to survive.

My father replaced the chimney, so we had sheets of lead flashing in the basement.  Didn't really know what it was, aside from being easy to bend, cut and hammer in to shapes.  

Some time later, I figured out how to get the torch lit, and you could melt the lead in to shapes.  Which made me think, what else can you melt?  Well, galvanized nails would burn this pretty fluorescent yellow color, but I always felt like shit afterward for some reason.  

The ammo?  I have no idea.  My parents never had any firearms, so my only guess is that a friend who had knowledge of my largely unsupervised basement access brought it over.  We had the bright idea of sawing it open, which worked fine for a bit, then one of them went off.  My friend got a bit of shrapnel in his arm, so we decided to knock that off for the day.

Ghetto lottery refers to an attempt to get into an altercation with the police, get injured, and then sue the police for mad $. 

Attempts like that are made at other institutions as well. Public baths, schools etc. Unless that tape is released and shows very clearly what is going on, you should see this story as an attempt to get a millon dollar settlement from the school (hence the emphasiz on the school "taking responsibility" for something that happened during its closing hours).

This doesn't really answer your question, but Guantanamo really doesn't have the infrastructure to support a ton of people. There have been issues in the past where immigrants from Cuba flooded the base. Research Camp X-Ray's "excludables" if you're interested. My family was split up for a while because my mom and I had to leave the base for that.

I'm curious as well whether the emissions regulations are doing more harm than good.

Is cleaner exhaust really better if it reduces your fuel economy by 20%?  That's a whole extra gallon for every 5 gallons of gas you use - an extra gallon of crude oil that needs to be extracted, transported, refined, transported again, etc.  Is the extraction & refining process really so "clean" that increasing all of these by 20% doesn't matter?

Not to mention the economic impact of the 20% increase in my fuel costs every month.

Exactly!  Girls have no idea how few responses guys get, then when the date finally comes, just how much crazy was hidden-- but at this point for the guy, it's one of the small handful of girls you've actually gotten a response from in the past week, so you decide what level of crazy you are willing to accept.  Girls are just as equal part chaff/wheat, only guys don't get 1/10th the responses girls do.  So it's like a fraction of a fraction for guys.  We are definitely fucked in that regard.
If you win it gets published though.
lol yea the guy is freaking retarded for disregarding what the police said literally that same day, especially for such a hefty crime.

But to be fair, when I was 14, I would've definitely been down to sleep with an adult. 
I think the law is like that to prevent older ppl from manipulating kids in to doing stuff they maybe wouldn't want to.

Specially if they use voip and a modified asterix server... Or other VoIP software.

Well but that's pretty true on both sides. Being fat is perceived poorly on both genders. Although I will say men can be chubbier than women and still get away with it, but trust me as a former fat guy, fat is fat. Almost no one is into that regardless of gender or orientation.

Had a garage sale a couple of years ago and wanted to put some underwear out with the clothes we had for sale. They were in good condition, I just didn't like how they fit. 

My wife laughed and said there was no way anyone would buy used underwear not packaged at a garage sale, but I put them out anyway. 

First couple who came up (nice Hispanic couple) loaded up on kids clothes, AND my underwear!! Didn't ask a thing, other than how much for all of these. My wife was in shock, and I was ecstatic! Teased her all day about how I'm so hot strangers will pay for my used underwear. Too fun.......

My dad's side is normally really conservative/gender traditional, but a few years back my aunts started a tradition where the men clean up the kitchen (before going to watch football/while watching the kitchen TV) while the women do some kind of activity (usually a craft). Still gender segregated, but I do feel kinda proud of them for trying something new.

Went out with a guy to a bar for a couple drinks. He decided he wanted to get me drunk, so there is this trick where you hit the top of a beer bottle with the bottom of another, and it starts to foam and it is supposed to force people to chug their drink. 

Well he hit it too hard, and ended up breaking part of the bottle off, then he proceeded to grab the beer and chug it himself, glass and all.

He continued to drink heavily, until he passed out cold at the table. 

I invited a friend to the bar, where we sat and laughed at him passed out, I paid my half of the tab and we left.
You can do that too. I mean it takes longer and it's not instant but you can have multiple orgasms. Your lady would probably appreciate the effort too I mean slapping her ass on the way back from the fridge when you get a beer doesn't count as forplay no matter how enthusiastically you argue the point Brian and FALLING ASLEEP DOESN'T COUNT AS CUDDLING EITHER YOUR SO SELFISH.
Again, when you are poor, you buy a whole, thing, you CANNOT customize. And you need 3 meals a day too, so you eat 3 times. So you go to the nearest store and buy whatever you can from the money. Or eat whatever you are given. The food you eat will be bite sized but made with unhealthy oils preservatives and sodium which will add up to the calories

I am appalled at the kind of ignorant people who have no idea about anything spouting hate. I can see a clear picture of a guy sitting in his well to do parents house and judging others I know why FPH was a thing

Opening and creating compressed file archives, such as .zip files. 

In case you're not familiar with compression or zip files, by compressing a file or a folder (with many files in it) it takes up less space on your hard drive, and one use is to make it easier to send files to someone else via email or other means.

I am so glad that my parents never felt the need to drag me and my brother out every Thanksgiving to see the relatives. Not because we don't like them or anything, but they all live over 6 hours away and we don't have time for that kind of shit.
I'll never understand weird shit like this. *Were all the participants consenting adults* should be the only issue.

At what age can a person be trusted to decide for themselves if they want to watch people pee on the internet?  Why does government play any role in this decision?
I've been shaving my legs (am dude) for eight years now, and I'm originally from SoCal (Shorts weather, rain or sunshine). 

Nobody ever noticed. If you let it stubble that's a different story, or if you're super hairy then barren legs might stand out, but if you fall anywhere in within six miles of normal, people never notice. And if they do, they rarely ever comment. 

I expected to get bullied for it in high school. The only person who noticed (he is a talker) shrugged it off. It's been several years since then and only 1 other person noticed and asked about it and I just said I hated body hair. Done. 
Not having all your opposite sex friends wanting to have sex with you. I don't even mean this in a cocky way, I'm seriously mildly attractive at best but I know that any guy that wants to hang, wants to bang. Other girls scare me so I usually try to be friends with guys but I have to constantly make sure we aren't alone together or they will pull some weird shit and I have to find a random excuse to leave. I JUST WANT A PLATONIC MALE FRIEND. ITS SO CREEPY WHEN YOURE FRIEND IS CLEARLY ERECT AND TRYING TO MAKE A MOVE. Ugh.

I pretty much stopped bothering with tinder, while I was relatively successful in getting dates with it, I realized that it was effecting me the same way. All the ghosting I experienced on top of 4/5 matches just never responding in the first place started making me just really hateful towards women in general, and insecure and kind of hateful of myself as well. Once I realized what it was doing to me I stopped and those feelings went with it, and a healthier mindset has actually helped my dating life drastically.
Not paying welfare isn't an option and is just becoming more and more important as globalization and technology outsource/remove jobs. We are going to get to a point where the choices are tax those with jobs to take care of those without or let everyone without die. I choose not to let people die when there are plenty of resources for everyone. 
Maybe chrome has gotten worse in terms of RAM gobbling, but it has always been the fastest browser on all my machines since it came out. Back around 09, I put it on our old dino of a desktop (half gig ram) and it could actually internet again vs IE or firefox. My old laptop (bought late 06) perked up internet speed wise when chrome came out as well. 

So it may gobble ram, but even on those old computers with half and 1 gig ram respectively, it ran amazingly and still allowed other programs to run well. 
I was working armed security in a bad part of Virginia, guy really wanted his $200 of Sudafed.
So maybe the "safety net" is creating more poverty then.

You might have read what I said but you talked about destroying the "safety net" creating more crime and yet when that "safety net" was created crime went up.

It's not uncommon. A lot of orphanages double as public daycares, and not objecting when a couple gets attached to the wrong kid can net a big enough donation to add protein to the orphan's meals for a year.

I sprained my neck chopping wood when I was 16 and apparently if you sprain your neck once you become much more susceptible to spraining it again.  I'm in my mid 20s now and have sprained it twice more since then, once drying myself off with a towel too vigorously and the second time by sneezing.  I wish I was joking.  And I lift weights a lot, I pull three plates, but I can sprain my neck by sneezing.  Life's funny.
